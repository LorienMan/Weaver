/// Possible cases:
/// - transient: the `DependencyContainer` always creates a new instance when the type is resolved.
/// - container: builds an instance at initialization of its container and keeps it for the lifetime its container.
/// - weak: a new instance is created when resolved the first time and then lives for the time its strong references are living and shared with children.
/// - lazy: a new instance is created when resolved the first time and has the same lifetime than its container.
